# ðŸ§¬ SMILES Property Predictor

A Python-based tool to predict **molecular properties** directly from **SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System)** strings using a combination of **RDKit** (rule-based cheminformatics) and **Machine Learning models** for advanced predictions like **solubility (LogS)** and **toxicity**.

---

## ðŸ§ª What Are SMILES?

**SMILES** (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a compact string notation used to describe the structure of chemical molecules. For example:
```

Aspirin â†’ `CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O`

````

These strings encode atoms, bonds, rings, and branches in a form that can be easily parsed and analyzed by cheminformatics tools like RDKit.

## ðŸ§  What This Project Does

Given a SMILES string, this tool predicts **12 important molecular properties**, including:

|  No. | Property              |  Description                                      | Why It's Important                                                              |
| -----: | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|      1 | **Canonical SMILES**     | A standardized form of the SMILES string.            | Helps ensure consistency when comparing or storing molecules.                   |
|      2 | **Molecular Formula**    | Elemental composition (e.g. C9H8O4).                 | Fundamental chemical identity â€” needed in molecular databases and search.       |
|      3 | **Molecular Weight**     | Total molecular mass in Daltons (g/mol).             | Useful for pharmacokinetics and dosing calculations.                            |
|      4 | **LogP**                 | Octanolâ€“water partition coefficient (lipophilicity). | Measures how hydrophobic a compound is â€” affects absorption, distribution, etc. |
|      5 | **H-Bond Donors**        | Count of -OH or -NH groups.                          | Affects solubility and interaction with biological targets.                     |
|      6 | **H-Bond Acceptors**     | Count of oxygen or nitrogen atoms with lone pairs.   | Important for molecular recognition and binding.                                |
|      7 | **TPSA (Ã…Â²)**            | Topological Polar Surface Area.                      | Estimates a moleculeâ€™s ability to cross membranes (e.g., blood-brain barrier).  |
|      8 | **Rotatable Bonds**      | Number of flexible single bonds.                     | Higher values indicate more flexibility â€” affects oral bioavailability.         |
|      9 | **Formal Charge**        | Net ionic charge on the molecule.                    | Impacts solubility, reactivity, and membrane permeability.                      |
|     10 | **QED Score**            | Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (0â€“1).        | A machine-learned score combining multiple rules â€” higher is better for drugs.  |
|     11 | **Solubility (LogS)**    | Aqueous solubility (in Log mol/L).                   | Critical ADME property â€” low solubility limits drug formulation.                |
|     12 | **Toxicity Probability** | Probability of being toxic to human cells (0â€“1).     | Prevents late-stage drug failure and ensures safety during drug discovery.      |

## ðŸ“Š How the Models Work

* **Rule-based properties** are directly extracted using RDKit.
* **Solubility** is predicted using a **regression model** trained on the ESOL dataset with **XGBoost**.
* **Toxicity** is predicted using a **Graph Convolutional Network** from DeepChem trained on the **Tox21** dataset.
